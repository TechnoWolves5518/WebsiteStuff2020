                <p>
                    Techno Wolves FRC Team 5518 is a high school student-led FIRST Robotics Competition team based in Apex, North Carolina. We
                    are a fourth-year community-based team partnered with Wake STEM Early College High School at NC State
                    University. Techno Wolves serves as a valuable learning experience to all of our members; the team
                    structure is based off of an existing model in the corporate world, giving members an early, competitive
                    edge when applying for jobs and college. Additionally, our robotics program encourages students to
                    actively promote the team by attending outreach events, participating in community service, raising
                    funds, and reaching out to local businesses/organizations to support us.

                        Our Mission - “To enrich the minds of high school students by promoting an innovative learning experience with our community
                        – such as local businesses, schools, and mentors – via the exploration of science, technology,
                        engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) through the exposure of robotics and business management
                        principles.”
